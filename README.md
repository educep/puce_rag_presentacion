# Getting started
1. Create the environment
    ```sh
    make create_environment
    ```
2. Install packages. If you are on Windows, the following command 
   will try to install CUDA. 
   
   Comment out the corresponding line in Makefile if you are not equipped with a GPU.
    ```sh
    make requirements
    ```
